# Create Django Project Script

A bash script to create and setup a Django project.

**The script will do the following:**

- Creates a virtual environment and installs Django.
- Creates a django project using the `PACKAGE_NAME` and APPS.
- Set static root and media root rules.
- Update `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` to read from environment variables.
- Update `TEMPLATES` rule in settings.
- If the database argument `(-d)` is recognised, then set the appropriate environment for `DB_ENGINE`.
- If the database argument `(-d)` is recongised, then update the database settings.
- In the projects root `urls.py` file, create include rules routing to an url file in each app directory.
- Inside each app directory create a `urls.py` file with basic configurations.
- Remove `views.py` and `tests.py` in each directory and create a views and tests directory with an `__init__.py` inside each directory.
- In each app directory create template and static directories with related sub-directories.
- Updates `INSTALLED_APPS`.
